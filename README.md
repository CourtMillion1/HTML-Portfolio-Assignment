    <h1>Dear Prospect</h1>
        <p>First and foremost I would like to thank you for taking me into consideration. 
         My name is Courtney Hamilton and I've been dabbling in Computer Software Engineering 
         since 2014.  I first started by taking a computer coding introduction class at Northwest 
         Florida State College.
        </p>
        <p>Then I proceeded to study HTML & CSS on my own through Udemy.  My desire to pursue coding
            as a career led me to Helio Training, a Full Stack Web Development Academy where I am studying
            to be a Full Stack Web Developer.  I will be graduating in early 2021.  
        </p>
        <p>I have well over 600 hours of coding experience and I'm still in pursuit of my Bachelors degree
            at UoPeople in Computer Software Development.  This is my passion and my pursuit of happiness.  
            I thank you for your time and make it a great day. 
        </p>
